## Ascalon Discord Bot

Ascalon is a social discord bot that combines the use of RiotAPI to get statistics of Summoner games (such as scoring points for victories or defeats) and the code of the social platform with tight integration with RiotAPI. Mainly RiotAPI used for verify/associate discord user with his League profile. As for social part, users of our Discord Channel can type !boast command, and bot will take a last Summoner game (associated with that user via thrid-party auth code) and our user will recieve a gold coins ("social coins", etc.) at our discord channel.
